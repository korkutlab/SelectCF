Description: A package for accurate and robust feature selection coupled with clustering. It contains implementations of sparse hierarchical clustering (SHC) and five novel algorithms. Briefly, we advance SHC and obtain two algorithms: SelectCF-FL, which replaces lasso with fused lasso to incorporate prior information of feature order, and SelectCF, which replaces lasso with spike-and-slab lasso to debias the effect of lasso without a priori information. Further, rSHC, rSelectCF-FL, and rSelectCF, are robust versions of SHC, SelectCF-FL, and SelectCF, respectively, in which selected features are robust to the existence of outliers. Among the presented algorithms, SelectCF and rSelectCF have the best performances in outlier-free datasets and outlier-existing datasets, respectively. These two algorithms achieve close-to-ideal feature selection coupled with clustering.
